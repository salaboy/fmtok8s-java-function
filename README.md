# Function project

Welcome to your new Function project!

This sample project contains a single function based on Spring Cloud Function: `uppercase.CloudFunctionApplication.uppercase()`, which returns the uppercase of the data passed via CloudEvents.

## Local execution

Make sure that `Java 11 SDK` is installed.

To start server locally run `./mvnw spring-boot:run`.
The command starts http server and automatically watches for changes of source code.
If source code changes the change will be propagated to running server. It also opens debugging port `5005`
so a debugger can be attached if needed.

To run tests locally run `./mvnw test`.

## The `func` CLI

It's recommended to set `FUNC_REGISTRY` environment variable.

```shell script
# replace ~/.bashrc by your shell rc file
# replace docker.io/johndoe with your registry
export FUNC_REGISTRY=docker.io/johndoe
echo "export FUNC_REGISTRY=docker.io/johndoe" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Building

This command builds an OCI image for the function. By default, this will build a GraalVM native image.

```shell script
func build -v                  # build native image
```

**Note**: If you want to disable the native build, you need to edit the `func.yaml` file and
remove (or set to false) the following BuilderEnv variable:
```
buildEnvs:
  - name: BP_NATIVE_IMAGE
    value: "true"
```


### Running

This command runs the func locally in a container
using the image created above.

```shell script
func run
```

### Deploying

This command will build and deploy the function into cluster.

```shell script
func deploy -v # also triggers build
```

## Function invocation

Spring Cloud Functions allows you to route CloudEvents to specific uppercase using the `Ce-Type` attribute.
For this example, the CloudEvent is routed to the `uppercase` function. You can define multiple uppercase inside this project
and then use the `Ce-Type` attribute to route different CloudEvents to different Functions.
Check the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file for the `functionRouter` configurations.
Notice that you can also use `path-based` routing and send the any event type by specifying the function path,
for this example: "$URL/uppercase".

For the examples below, please be sure to set the `URL` variable to the route of your function.

You get the route by following command.

```shell script
func info
```

Note the value of **Routes:** from the output, set `$URL` to its value.

__TIP__:

If you use `kn` then you can set the url by:

```shell script
# kn service describe <function name> and show route url
export URL=$(kn service describe $(basename $PWD) -ourl)
```

### cURL

curl -v "http://localhost:8080/" \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-H "Ce-Id:1" \
-H "Ce-Subject:Uppercase" \
-H "Ce-Source:cloud-event-example" \
-H "Ce-Type:uppercase" \
-H "Ce-Specversion:1.0" \
-d "{\"input\": \"salaboy\"}\""

Using CloudEvents `Ce-Type` routing:
```shell script
curl -v "$URL/" \
  -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
  -H "Ce-Id:1" \
  -H "Ce-Subject:Uppercase" \
  -H "Ce-Source:cloud-event-example" \
  -H "Ce-Type:uppercase" \
  -H "Ce-Specversion:1.0" \
  -d "{\"input\": \"$(whoami)\"}\""
```

Using Path-Based routing:
```shell script
curl -v "$URL/uppercase" \
  -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
  -H "Ce-Id:1" \
  -H "Ce-Subject:Uppercase" \
  -H "Ce-Source:cloud-event-example" \
  -H "Ce-Type:my-event" \
  -H "Ce-Specversion:1.0" \
  -d "{\"input\": \"$(whoami)\"}\""
```

### HTTPie

Using CloudEvents `Ce-Type` routing:
```shell script
http -v "$URL/" \
  Content-Type:application/json \
  Ce-Id:1 \
  Ce-Subject:Uppercase \
  Ce-Source:cloud-event-example \
  Ce-Type:uppercase \
  Ce-Specversion:1.0 \
  input=$(whoami)
```

Using Path-Based routing:
```shell script
http -v "$URL/uppercase" \
  Content-Type:application/json \
  Ce-Id:1 \
  Ce-Subject:Uppercase \
  Ce-Source:cloud-event-example \
  Ce-Type:uppercase \
  Ce-Specversion:1.0 \
  input=$(whoami)
```

## Cleanup

To remove the deployed function from your cluster, run:

```shell
func delete
```
